This is DDS (codename) and it is supposed to be a
distributed and scalable datastore. The API is 
similar to S3.

At this point, the implementation is very basic.

To run our implementation:

1.  Use start_stores.sh in the src/store directory to start up the store servers
2.  Use start_dds.sh in src/dds directory to start up 4 dds servers
3.  Test using whatever scripts you want.
