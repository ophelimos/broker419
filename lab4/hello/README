For a detailed description of this example, please have a look at the
"Getting started" section of the ORBacus manual.


Unix
====

To start this demo, first run the server with:

CLASSPATH=../../lib:classes:$CLASSPATH java hello.Server

Or you can start the TIE server using:

CLASSPATH=../../lib:classes:$CLASSPATH java hello.Server_tie

Start the client with:

CLASSPATH=../../lib:classes:$CLASSPATH java hello.Client

The collocated demo can be started using:

CLASSPATH=../../lib:classes:$CLASSPATH java hello.Collocated


Windows
=======

To start this demo, first run the server with:

set CLASSPATH=..\..\lib;classes;%CLASSPATH%
java hello.Server

Or you can start the TIE server using:

set CLASSPATH=..\..\lib;classes;%CLASSPATH%
java hello.Server_tie

Start the client with:

set CLASSPATH=..\..\lib;classes;%CLASSPATH%
java hello.Client

The collocated demo can be started using:

set CLASSPATH=..\..\lib;classes;%CLASSPATH%
java hello.Collocated

If you use the Microsoft Visual J++, use the command "jview" instead
of "java".


Applet
======

The client can also be run as an applet with the "appletviewer" tool.
The server automatically generates the file "Hello.html".

Under Unix, you can run the client with:

CLASSPATH=../../lib:classes:$CLASSPATH appletviewer Hello.html

Under Windows, use:

set CLASSPATH=..\..\lib;classes;%CLASSPATH%
appletviewer Hello.html


Netscape
========

In order to use this applet in Netscape, the Hello.html file must be
loaded from a Web server. If you load the file from the local filesystem,
Netscape will raise a SecurityException when the applet attempts to
contact the server.

Note that the Hello server must be running on the same host as the Web
server.
